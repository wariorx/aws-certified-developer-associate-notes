# Kurbenetes
* Portable and extensible open-source platform for managing containerized owrkloads and services.

# EKS
* Leverage Kurbenetes to orchestrate workloads in AWS.
* Manaaged service that can be used without needing to install, operate, and maintain a Kurbenetes control plane or nodes.
* Advanced orchestration solution taht offers more fine-grained control over the infrastructure
* Recommended if already running Kurbenetes services
* Similar to ECS but differs in:
  1. The machine that runs a container is called a worker node or Kurbenetes node instead of container instance
  2. Containers are called pods
  3. Runs on Kurbenetes instead of AWS native technology
